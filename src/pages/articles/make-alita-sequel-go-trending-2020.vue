            <blockquote>
              Disney would be wise to diversify a little bit, and put some of its eggs into the Alita: Battle Angel
              basket. There’s rich soil for a new franchise here, with multiple sequels and spin-offs, including a video
              game spin-off. Hell, I’d play a Motorball spin-off video game. That could be awesome.
