            <li>Be <strong>polite</strong>, <strong>kind</strong> and <strong>generous</strong>.</li>
            <li>Assume journalists have the best intentions.</li>
            <li>
              Be prepared with three or four good talking points as to why you enjoyed Alita: Battle Angel and why
              others should see it. Be sure to compliment the cast and crew, especially Rosa Salazar.
            </li>
            <li>
              Indicate that it’s important for people who enjoy the movie to buy the digital or disc release to help
              support sequels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage the journalist (and their audience) to read the manga if they really want to understand why the
              fans are so dedicated. The manga is so good that it strongly reinforces fan support for the movie, and it
              would definitely change the perspective of anyone who hasn’t read it yet. Plus it won’t hurt for Kishiro
              to
              sell a few more copies of his great work.

              > Captain Marvel</a> or any other movie perceived as competition to Alita: Battle Angel, simply
              state they are different movies with different stories and should succeed on their own merits. Feel free
              to vary your response, but don’t take the bait of wading into <strong>“controversy.”</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              If asked about political issues, the correct answer is that Alita: Battle Angel is a great movie in part
              because it stays away from political statements and instead focuses on the story and characters (imagine
              that). I don’t think there is a single person anywhere in this fandom that would want to change that.
            </li>
            <li>Proofread your statements and spell-check them whenever possible.</li>
            <li>
              Thank the journalist for their time and effort and make sure you offer to be contacted in the future for
              follow-up stories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Retain copies of all correspondence to and from the journalist. Use screenshots if needed. This is to help
              prevent you from being quoted inaccurately or taken out of context. In the unlikely case you are asked to
              participate in a video or audio interview, try to record your own copy, dress professionally, and smile.
              <br />
              <strong>
                For legal reasons, it’s best to ask permission to record your own audio or video copy of the
                interview; be wary if you are told no. Look up “two-party consent state” and see the

              DM <a class="link-white" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sir_Psychotron/">u/Sir_Psychotron</a> if for

              Remember, at this point any publicity is good publicity in order to sell the movie. Even if you suspect
              the journalist has ulterior motives, simply follow the above recommendations and be as polite as possible.
              Do not accuse them of pushing an agenda.
