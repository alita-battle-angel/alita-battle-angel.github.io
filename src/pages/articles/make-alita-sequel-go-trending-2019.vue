          <h4>Mission Description</h4>
          <p>
            We want a sequel to Alita: Battle Angel. The Experience we had in the cinema was remarkable. And we want to
            feel that magic again. And since Disney is now in charge with the distribution of ALita, we need to reach
            out to them to make the Sequel happen.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What can I do?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We need to make noise. We need to make the hashtag
            <NuxtLink class="link-white" to="/fans?filterBy=AlitaSequel">
              #AlitaSequel
            </NuxtLink>
            go trending. Not now, but all together at
            the same time worldwide. For one hour we Tweet, we unleash hell.

              "What I think the Alita Army should do is keep peppering our family now at Disney and [let them know] how
              important it is to have another Alita movie and hopefully we'll venture there one day."
